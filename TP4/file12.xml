Anarchism
</emph3> is a generic term describing various

political philosophies
</collectionlink> and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="234984.xml">

<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="12229.xml">
government
</collectionlink>. Most types of anarchism are on the left but some are on the right. In place of coercive and socially-enforced hierarchies, centralized political structures, and exploitative institutions, these movements advocate social relations based upon voluntary interaction and self-management, and aspire to a society characterised by autonomy and freedom. These philosophies use 
<emph2>
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="631.xml">
anarchy
</collectionlink></emph2> to mean a 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="37235.xml">
society
</collectionlink> based on 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="32705.xml">
voluntary
</collectionlink> interaction of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="11175.xml">
free
</collectionlink> individuals, and the idea that communities and individuals have a say in decisions to the degree that they are affected by their outcomes.
<p>
As anarchism is defined by its opposition to government, the positive visions of how a voluntary society might work vary considerably. Opinions differ in various areas, such as whether 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="46112.xml">
violence
</collectionlink> should be employed to foster anarchism, what type of economic system should exist, questions on the environment and industrialism, and anarchists' roles in other movements.
</p>The terms "anarchy" and "anarchism" are derived from the

</collectionlink>) wrote what would become core anarchist critiques of government, economics, and society; though he did not use the word 
<emph2>
anarchism
</emph2>, some today regard him as the "founder of philosophical anarchism" 
<p>
By "political justice" Godwin meant "the adoption of any principle of morality and truth into the practice of a community," and his characteristically anarchist conclusion was that government in fact inhibits rather than fosters justice.
</p><p>
Godwin's philosophy was optimistic about the potential for human beings to develop and conduct social relations on the basis of reason and consent. He believed that there are no innate principles, and therefore no original propensity to evil. He considered that "our virtues and our vices may be traced to the incidents which make the history of our lives, and if these incidents could be divested of every improper tendency, vice would be extirpated from the world." The control of man by man in general, and the institution of government in particular, are detrimental to human development. "Government by its very nature counteracts the improvement of original mind."

1840
</collectionlink> that the term "anarchist" was adopted as a self-description.  It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. 
</p><p>
In 
<emph2>
What is Property
</emph2> Proudhon answers with the famous accusation "Property is theft." In this work he opposed the institution of property (
<emph2>
propriété
</emph2>) bestowed and enforced by state privilege. On the other hand, Proudhon supported private property held by individuals gained through their own labour or voluntary trade.  He asserted the ""Property 
<unknownlink src="is">
is
</unknownlink> a triumph of Liberty. For it is born of Liberty ... Property is the only power that can act as a counterweight to the State, because it shows no reverence for princes, rebels against society and is, in short, anarchist." Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called mutualism (
<emph2>
mutuellisme
</emph2>), involved a non-coercive exchange economy where individuals and groups could own property and trade the produce of their labour. This would be a market system, but without profit - goods would be traded on the basis of the labour time, and mutualist banks would lend without interest. 
</p><p>
Proudhon generally opposed violent expropriation of property; instead he advocated programs (including the formation of an interest-free community-owned bank, which would become the prototype for modern 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="246079.xml">
credit unions
</collectionlink>) whereby workers would create mutual organisations that could supplant capitalism and render the state superfluous. Proudhon's ideas began to exert some influence within French working class movements, and his followers were active in the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="274046.xml">
Revolution of 1848 in France
</collectionlink>. However authoritarian socialist tendencies such as Blanquism were a stronger force in Proudhon's own time. 
</p><p>
Proudhon's work on property raised a central issue in the future development of anarchism. The question of property, and its place in an anarchist society, is sometimes seen as dividing anarchism thereafter into two major streams or tendencies which can loosely be called 'individualism' and 'collectivism'.  Proudhon consistently opposed ideas of communism, and his reply to the motto "each according to his needs" was: "To each according to his works, first; and if, on occasion, I am impelled to aid you, I will do it with a good grace; but I will not be constrained" (
<emph2>
The Philosophy of Misery
</emph2>). Proudhon also debated and opposed the French économistes (

<unknownlink src="Frederic Bastiat's debate with Proudhon">

</p><p>
Proudhon was influential on the newly-developing

individualist anarchism in America
</collectionlink>, mainly through Benjamin Tucker who translated 
<emph2>
What is Property?
</emph2> However, Proudhon's mutualism was not altogether unique, as a system of labor exchange facilitated by "labor notes" was already being practiced in the United States under the guidance of Josiah Warren who had no knowledge of Proudhon.

Max Stirner
</collectionlink> is considered to be the first egoist of the individualist anarchists. Stirner considered the world and everything in it, including other persons, available to one's taking or use without moral constraint --that rights do not exist in regard to objects at all. Stirner is a supporter of property but holds that a

right
</emph2> to property is an illusion, or "ghost"; property is only a matter of control --it is not based in any moral right but solely in the right of might: "Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property." He sees no rationality in taking the interests of others into account unless doing so furthers one's self-interest, which he believed is the only legitimate reason for acting. His embrace of

 The  rich  man  always  puts  off the poor with the words, "What does your want concern me? See to  it  how  you    make  your  way  through the world; that is 
<emph2>
your affair
</emph2>, not mine." Well, let us let it be our affair, then, and  let  us not  let  the  means  that  we have  to  realise value from ourselves be  pilfered  from  us  by  the  rich.
</indentation1>He immediately adds that this is not motivated by egalitarian concerns, instead phrasing it in terms of payment for the full worth of labor: 
<indentation1>
 No, my good old sir, nothing of equality. We  only  want  to count for what we are worth, and, if you are worth more, you shall count for more right along. We only want to be 
<emph2>
worth our price
</emph2>, and think to show ourselves worth the price that you will pay.

Whether individualist anarchism is properly justified by self-interest (egoism) or natural law has been a subject of debate among later individualists. For example, Lysander Spooner argued that private property was based in natural law and espoused a

While individualist anarchism includes Proudhon and Max Stirner (and arguably Godwin), it is most often associated with the "market anarchism" or "private property anarchism" that was first formalized by the Americans. In 1825, 
<unknownlink src="Josiah Warren">
Josiah Warren
</unknownlink> had participated in a collectivist experiment headed by

New Harmony
</collectionlink>" that failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren came to the conclusion that the community's failure was due to a lack of individual sovereignty and private property. He held that in order to have a well-functioning society, "Society must be so converted as to preserve the SOVEREIGNTY OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL inviolate. That it must avoid all combinations and connections of persons and interests, and all other arrangements which will not leave every individual at all times at liberty to dispose of his or her person, and time, and property in any manner in which his or her feelings or judgment may dictate. WITHOUT INVOLVING THE PERSONS OR INTERESTS OF OTHERS" (
<emph2>
Practical Details
</emph2> (Warren's capitalization)) and that "by dispensing with government we shake off the greatest invader of human rights" (
<emph2>
Equitable Commerce
</emph2>). Thus began the individualist anarchist tradition in America by Warren, who is commonly regarded as the first American anarchist. Warren put his theories to practice by organizing anarchist colonies, including

</collectionlink>'s "law of equal liberty," and other theorists, into what is seen as a formalized individualist anarchist theory. This form of individualist anarchism strongly supports "private property" (a right of an individual to exercise exclusive domain over the product of his labor, as opposed to this product being relegated to a collective pool shared equally by the community) and a 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="48852.xml">
market economy
</collectionlink> where this property may be bought and sold. Wage labor is also supported, as long as wages adhere to the labor theory of value. This is in contrast to philosophies such as anarcho-communism, which seek to abolish money, private property, wages, and a market economy. However, classical individualists believe 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="90492.xml">
profit
</collectionlink> in economic relations to be a violation of the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="17629.xml">
labor theory of value
</collectionlink>. As capitalism is commonly understood to be a system where profit is made, the philosophy is also in contrast to capitalism. However, the classical individualists maintain that profit is only made possible by government-backed privilege for capital; and, if this were to cease prices would converge to their "natural rate" where profit was not possible. Private ownership of the means of production is advocated. However, most of these individualists oppose property titles to land that is not in use, as it is not the product of labor (Warren and Andrews are notable exceptions). They espouse an economic system called 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1799997.xml">
mutualism
</collectionlink> as an alternative to the profit-making of capitalism and the wealth collectivization of communism. Other 19th century individualists include

Ulrich von Beckerath

<emph2>
Our Demands as Individualist Anarchists
</emph2>, made the following demand: "FULL AND UNRESTRICTED RIGHT to determine and change the value or price of any goods, either one's own products or consumer goods, of whatever kind, according to one's own discretion. Likewise untouchable is the right to negotiate in this respect, to use an arbitrator or to do without any determination of values."  In the 1950's 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="20217.xml">
Murray Rothbard
</collectionlink> sought to formally integrate the subjective theory of value with the private property philosophy of the classical individualist anarchists: "There is, in the body of thought known as 'Austrian economics', a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung" (
<emph2>
Egalitarianism
</emph2>). This form individualism that does not oppose profit became known, by at least the late 1960's, as

</collectionlink>. But at the same  time the IWA began to polarise into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. 
</p><p>
Both sides had a stated common aim (stateless communism), and common political opponents (the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="743785.xml">
ruling class
</collectionlink>). But each was critical of the other, and the conflict between the two groups intensified. Perhaps the clearest differences emerged over proposed strategies for achieving their visions of socialism. The anarchists grouped around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) "direct economical struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation." Marxist thinking, at that time, focused on parliamentary activity. (Particularly when the new 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="12674.xml">
German Empire
</collectionlink> of 1871 became the first country to introduce manhood suffrage, leading many German socialists to focus their energies within the then Marxist

Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="3271.xml">

</collectionlink>, and predicted that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the

Unlike Marxism, anarchism has never had one central set of texts or authorities. But in the last three decades of the nineteenth century the anarchism of many of Bakunin's followers did gradually develop into a clearer position embracing an idea of communism.
</p><p>
An early proponent of anarchist communism was 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1739991.xml">
Joseph Déjacque
</collectionlink>. In 1857 Déjacque, who was initially a follower of Proudhon, wrote a letter to the latter objecting to his stance on feminism and his support for the individual ownership of the product of labor and a market economy: "it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature." Déjacque split from the Proudhonian philosophy and began publishing the first anarcho-communist journal in America called 
<emph2>
Le Libertaire
</emph2>, from 1858-1861. Déjacque is also notable as the first person to describe himself as a "

"The Italian Federation considers the collective property of the products of labour as the necessary complement to the collectivist programme, the aid of all for the satisfaction of the needs of each being the only rule of production and consumption which corresponds to the principle of solidarity."

In his 
<emph2>
Anarchie et Communisme
</emph2>, Cafiero argued that private property even in the product of labor (Mutualist 'possession') will lead to unequal accumulation of capital, and therefore to class distinctions.

Anarchist communists advocate an egalitarian society without markets or wages, based on the principle of "from each according to their ability, to each according to need." Decisions would be made through

Many anarchists would make a distinction between "violence" and "property destruction": they claim that violence is when a person inflicts harm to another person, while property destruction or property damage is not violence, although it can have indirect harm such as financial harm.

Anarcho-syndicalism formed a new wave of anarchism in beginning in the 1890's and 1900's. Even more than the anarchism of the International, this was anarchism brought out of the philosophy books and embodied in the ongoing struggle of millions of working class people.

After the fall of the Paris Commune in 1871 French anarchists and socialists had suffered a dark period of repression similar to the aftermath of the 1848 revolution. Anarchism began to resurface in the 1880's and 1890's, and was a particular influence upon the

Anarchism had been introduced into Spain by followers of Bakunin in the late 1860's, and quickly established itself as the dominant force within the Spanish socialist and working class movements. (See also -

In other parts of the world, anarcho-syndicalism lives on - although it is far from the force it once was (see below).

<title>Insurrectionary anarchism </title><p>
Insurrectionary anarchism is critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Here, 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1486408.xml">
Wolfi Landstreicher
</collectionlink> writes some of the basis points of its praxis.  
</p><blockquote>
Insurrectionary anarchism is not an ideological solution to all social problems, a commodity on the capitalist market of ideologies and opinions, but an on-going praxis aimed at putting an end to the domination of the state and the continuance of capitalism, which requires analysis and discussion to advance. We don’t look to some ideal society or offer an image of utopia for public consumption. Throughout history, most anarchists, except those who believed that society would evolve to the point that it would leave the state behind, have been insurrectionary anarchists. Most simply, this means that the state will not merely wither away, thus anarchists must attack, for waiting is defeat; what is needed is open mutiny and the spreading of subversion among the exploited and excluded. Here we spell out some implications that we and some other insurrectionary anarchists draw from this general problem: if the state will not disappear on its own, how then do we end its existence? It is, therefore, primarily a practice, and focuses on the organization of attack...The State of capital will not “wither away,” attack is the refusal of mediation, pacification, sacrifice, accommodation, and compromise.

Christian anarchism is the belief that there is only one source of authority to which

God
</collectionlink> as embodied in the teachings of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1095706.xml">
Jesus
</collectionlink>. Christian anarchists therefore feel that earthly authority such as 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="12229.xml">
government
</collectionlink>, or indeed the established church do not and should not have power over them. Christian anarchists are

Spiritual Anarchism, or Divine Anarchy, was originally expressed by the political revolutionary, poet and yogi

</collectionlink> in a series of articles published in the Arya, and later made available in two books, The Human Cycle and The Ideal of Human Unity. The exaggerations of both individualistic and communistic streams of anarchist thought are harmonized by going beyond the vital and intellectual foundations of most other schools of anarchism and rooting itself firmly in the spiritual realization and dynamic perfection of the individual and universal godhead in the race.
</p><p>
A spiritual anarchist holds that a perfect form of social organization can only be achieved by governing our individual and collective life by a higher light than the intellectual reason, a deeper law of solidarity and oneness than emotional or mental bonds of association.  Although it has deviated significantly from its course, the international township of

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally.

<title>The fight against fascism </title><p>
In the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of

</p><p>
Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:
</p><p>
<emph2>
Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.
</emph2></p>In France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. (see David Berry, ‘Fascism or Revolution!’ Anarchism and Antifascism in France, 1933-39*)

In Spain, the

</unknownlink> initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the right responded with an attempted coup, and the

But even before the eventual fascist victory, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Soviet-backed communists. Whilst the CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, Communist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and the revolution was destroyed.

<title>The platformist tradition </title><p>
A number of anarchist organisations in different countries take their inspiration from the 
<unknownlink src="Platformism">
Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists
</unknownlink>, a manifesto for anarchist organisation written by the 
<unknownlink src="Dielo Truda">

<outsidelink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/platform/plat_preface.html">
</outsidelink>. Platformists tend to describe themselves as anarchist-communists, and as 'class struggle' anarchists. 
</p><p>
Like the anarcho-syndicalists, with whom they have close relationships in many countries, they thus see themselves as continuing a tradition of revolutionary anarchism rooted in working class movements. Unlike anarcho-syndicalists, however, they believe in a role for separate and dedicated Anarchist revolutionary organisations outside of the trade union movement which are characterised by four principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'.

Primitivism is a philosophy advocating a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society, and a critique of industrial civilization, and the alienation that technology, progress, etc, have created between people and the natural world. Primitivism believes that industrial society inevitably produces oppressive structures through specialization of tasks or 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="8824.xml">
division of labor
</collectionlink>, and that

<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="6258.xml">
civilization
</collectionlink> itself.  Primitivism generally sees that by the birth of agriculture, and the birth of cities and the creating of production surplus, gave rise to structures of hierarchy, and later statism.  Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.

Post-left anarchy

Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional "left" - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of 
<unknownlink src="ideology">
ideology
</unknownlink> in general. It has rapidly developed since the fall of the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="26779.xml">
Soviet Union
</collectionlink>, which many view as the death of authoritarian leftism; however, its roots are clearly visible in the ideas of the 1960s 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="57521.xml">
Situationists
</collectionlink>. It is not an independent "movement" as such but rather a critical way of thinking about anarchist ideas.
</p><p>
Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary "leftist" movements and single issue causes (
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="214091.xml">

<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="2996055.xml">
anti-nuclear
</collectionlink>, etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of hierarchy. Total individual liberation is a key focus, rather than merely economic liberation.

<title>Personal practice </title>'''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. 
<p>
Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article 
<outsidelink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html">
Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?
</outsidelink>. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as "a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority." As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1547266.xml">
post-left anarchy
</collectionlink>, while Neal's insistence that it entails a rejection of the idea that there can be an "ultimate Truth" recalls the poststructuralist turns of post-anarchism (see above).
</p><p>
David Graeber and Andrej Grubacic offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, "the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun." 
<outsidelink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796">
</outsidelink> Graeber and Grubacic do not offer a comprehensive list of groups within this rubric, but suggest that it includes the likes of autonomism, Zapatismo and radical democracy. It should be stressed that many of these groups do not describe themselves as "anarchist", perhaps deliberately, and are grouped instead on the basis of what they do, implying that the criteria for inclusion are similar to those articulated by Neal.
</p><p>
It is unclear how far the term has been picked up by the wider anarchist movement, but it does help to clarify and begin to explain some of the conflicts and disagreements within contemporary anarchism.

Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state, and in fact many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a

</outsidelink>. Anarchists believe that if they were to support a war they would be strengthening the state â indeed,

Just as they are critical and distrustful of most government endeavours, anarchists often view the stated reasons for war with a

Many anarchists in the current movement however, reject complete pacifism, (although groups like Earth First!, and

Food Not Bombs
</collectionlink> are based on principles of non-violence), and instead are in favor of self-defense, and sometimes violence against oppressive and authoritarian forces which they in fact also consider as defensive violence. Anarchists are skeptical however of winning a direct armed conflict with the state, and instead concern themselves mostly with organizing. Most anarchists however, do not consider the destruction of property to be violent, as do most activists who believe in non-violence.

<title>Parliamentarianism </title><p>
While most anarchists firmly oppose voting, or otherwise participating in the State institution, there are a few that disagree.  Even hard-core anarchists (e.g. Proudhon) have succumbed to the temptation of electoral politics - and inevitably regretted it.

Voluntaryism
</collectionlink> is a anarchist school of thought which emphasizes "tending your own garden" and "neither ballots nor bullets."  The anarchist case against voting is explained in
